Tab searches the servers of UST to get course data and look for quota changes!

- It updates every 1.5 minutes to catch changes as quickly as possible!

Hill uses data collected by Tab to provide course info on demand! Using its slash commands, you can check:

- Quotas

Hill can also be added to other servers!
