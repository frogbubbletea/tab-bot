# üçÑ tab-bot
~~A Discord bot~~ **Two discord bots** that does helpful stuff with course quotas in HKUST! üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

## ü•Å Tab
Tab searches the servers of UST to get course data and look for quota changes!

- Tab [se](https://youtu.be/FXsGCieXm1E)nds notifications to a Discord server when changes are recorded!
- Updates every 1.5 minutes to catch changes as quickly as possible!

## üç¶ Hill
Hill uses data collected by Tab to provide course info on demand! Using its slash commands, you can check:

- Quotas
- Sections (schedules, venues, instructors)
- General information (pre-reqs, exclusions, descriptions)

of a course!

Hill can also be added to other servers!
